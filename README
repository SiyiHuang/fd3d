FD3D is a companion program of MaxwellFDFD.  It allows the users of MaxwellFDFD to solve the frequency-domain Maxwell's equations in a large 3D domain.  FD3D uses iterative methods to avoid the large memory requirement of direct solvers.

# Directory structure
The FD3D root directory consists of the following subdirectories:
- bin/
This directory will contain executables of the FD3D program and other utilities once they are built from the source codes in src/.  The main executable is fd3d.  To use these binaries, the path to this directory should be added to user's PATH evironment variable as instructed in INSTALL.

- example/
This directory contains example job scripts.

- src/
This directory contains the source codes and makefiles to build executables in bin/.


# Workflow
The general workflow to simulate EM wave propagation is described as follows.

- Create a project directory.

- Create input files from MaxwellFDFD and store them in the project directory
Input files describe the EM media and wave sources in the simulation domain. You need four input files, which are typically named as INPUT_NAME.h5, INPUT_NAME.eps.gz, INPUT_NAME.srcJ.gz, INPUT_NAME.srcM.gz.  The input files are generated by MaxwellFDFD, a companion MATLAB package.  For the usage of MaxwellFDFD, consult its documentation. 
If you run MaxwellFDFD (a MATLAB package) and FD3D on the same machine, you can create a MaxwellFDFD script in the same project directory.  Running the MaxwellFDFD script in MATLAB will create the input files for FD3D in the project directory.
If you run MaxwellFDFD and FD3D on different machines (e.g., MaxwellFDFD on your laptop and FD3D on a LINUX cluster), then you need to upload the input files created by MaxwellFDFD to the project directory on the machine where FD3D runs.

- Extract gzipped input files by
	gzip -d INPUT_NAME.{eps,srcJ,srcM}.gz
When creating input files, MaxwellFDFD gzips those files (except for a small file INPUT_NAME.h5) by default for convenience, because you typically need to upload them to an external LINUX cluster.

- Run fd3d.  
For a single processor, execute
	fd3d -i INPUT_NAME
For multiple processors, execute
	mpirun -n N fd3d -i INPUT_NAME
where INPUT_NAME is the base name of the input files, and N is the number of processors.
Instead of running fd3d interactively, you can submit a batch job script if your system manages a job queue, e.g. TORQUE Resource Manager.  Refer to the user guide of your system for more detail about writing a batch job script.

- Check the standard output.
You should check stdout generated by fd3d to see if fd3d has run successfully.

- Examine the solution.
The solution of the frequency-domain Maxwell's equations is stored in INPUT_NAME.E.h5 and INPUT_NAME.H.h5 files, which contain the E- and H-field of the solution, respectively.  The solution in these files can be visualized in MaxwellFDFD.  See the MaxwellFDFD documentation.
