# Directory structure
The FD3D root directory consists of the following subdirectories:
- bin/
This directory will contain executables of the FD3D program and other utilities once they are built from the source codes in src/.  The main executable is fd3d.  To use these binaries, the path to this directory should be added to user's PATH evironment variable as instructed in INSTALL.

- example/
This directory contains example job scripts.

- src/
This directory contains the source codes and makefiles to build executables in bin/.


# Workflow
The general workflow to simulate EM wave propagation is described as follows.

- Create a project directory.

- Create an input file (.py).
An input file describes the EM media and wave sources in the simulation domain.  You can copy project_example/template/template.py and fill the necessary lines or modify other input files of the example projcets in project_example/.

- Run fd3d.  
For a single processor, execute
	fd3d -i INPUT_NAME
For multiple processors, execute
	mpirun -n N fd3d -i INPUT_NAME
where N is the number of processors.  Note that INPUT_NAME is without the file name extension ".py".
Instead of running fd3d interactively, you can submit a batch job script if your system runs TORQUE Resource Manager.  Some projects in project_example/ contains example batch job scripts (.job).  Refer to the user guide of your system for more detail about writing a batch job script.

- Check the standard output.
You should check stdout to see if fd3d has run successfully.

- Examine the solution.
The solution of the frequency-domain Maxwell's equations is in .E and .H files, which contain the E field and H field, respectively.  The solution in these files can be visualized by using the MATLAB scripts in matlab/.  To use the scripts, see MATLAB/README.
